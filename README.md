J.A.R.V.I.S. is a python programme, basically a voice assistant which can respond to human voice made with various different modules of Python Programming language. J.A.R.V.I.S. is inspired from the well-known movie series of Marvel Cinematic Universe. It can send an email, a whatsapp message, open anything on web browser if the command with respect to is added, can play songs from your device as well as from any other platfrom and so on... It can do many more things..
You first need to import all required modules given in the programme by using pip install module_name command (P.S.: For knowing the module name you can search on pypi.org)
For the GRaphic User Interface of J.A.R.V.I.S. you can use QT Designer. For adding the GUI in the programme I suugest to take a look at some online sources.
